# About Me

_I am not special, and probably you can relate with this or similar situations, independently of your job or role._

I am just another Software Developer that likes flexibility in a **hybrid-work setup**:
a good balance between **collaboration at office**, **focus-work at home**, and keeping **work-life balance** during the weekdays.

In 2026 my company decided that the policy of 4 days/month office (established after COVID rules) should not be applied any longer.
Instead, a 2 days/week mandate substitutes the previous agreement that was considered also a benefit by many.
In my current lifestyle and situation, this challenges my work-life balance.
**The situation of other colleagues may be even more challenging.**

For this reason, I wear every office day a T-Shirt with the previous design.
Other colleagues wanted to join this movement, so I did this website to provide it.
And now, this is open for everyone that may face a similar situation.
