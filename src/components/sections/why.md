# Why?

**Home office** became a **benefit** in many companies, when possible in the job, during COVID.
It has been demonstrated that in this setup it is possible to maintain the **productivity and collaboration**, while allowing better **life-work balance** for employees.
Nevertheless, **mandated Return-To-Ofifce (RTO)** is becoming a trend in management for different reasons ([references](#references)).

This movement has the purpose to provide the means to express during office days the **disconfort with this policy**.
What I request is a **hybrid solution** that works for **everyone**, without mandates or enforcement.
Thus, I would like to clarify that the movement doesn't support any of the following solutions:

- Enforce 100% home office, as many people need to have a place to work due to their personal life conditions and style
- Avoid to go to the office, as there are cases where socializing and collaboration is necessary (onboarding colleagues, brainstorming, meeting with people you work with)
